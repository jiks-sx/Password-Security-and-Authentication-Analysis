# Lab 04 – Offline Attack Demonstration

## Objective
Understand why hashing alone does not stop attackers.

## Theory Mapping
Related to:
- Offline attacks
- Why hashes get cracked

## Step 1: Create a Hash File
echo "482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38" > hash.txt

(This is MD5 of password123)

## Step 2: Explain the Attack Model
Attacker:
- Has hash
- No rate limits
- Unlimited guesses

## Learning Outcome
Once a database is leaked, system defenses no longer apply.
