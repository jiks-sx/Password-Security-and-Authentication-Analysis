# Lab 01 – Environment Setup

## Objective
Prepare a safe and ethical environment to perform password security experiments.

## Why This Lab Exists
Security testing must never be done on real users or systems.
We use self-created passwords and hashes only.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Hashcat
- RockYou wordlist

## Verification Commands

Check Hashcat:
hashcat --version

Check wordlist:
ls /usr/share/wordlists/

## Ethical Note
All experiments are performed on self-generated data.
This follows ethical hacking principles.
