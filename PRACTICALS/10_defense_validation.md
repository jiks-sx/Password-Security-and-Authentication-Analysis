# Lab 10 – Defense Validation

## Objective
Validate real-world password defense strategies.

## Defense Layers
- Strong password hashing (bcrypt / Argon2)
- Long and random passwords
- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Account lockout
- Logging and monitoring

## Key Insight
Security assumes passwords will eventually fail.

Defense strategies reduce impact and slow attackers.

## Final Learning
Defense in depth is essential for real-world security.
