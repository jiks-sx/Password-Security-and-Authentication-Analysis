# Lab 03 – Hash Identification

## Objective
Identify hash types based on structure and length.

## Theory Mapping
Related to:
- Hash algorithms
- Offline attack preparation

## Step 1: Observe Hash Length

MD5:
32 hexadecimal characters

SHA-1:
40 hexadecimal characters

SHA-256:
64 hexadecimal characters

## Step 2: Why Identification Matters
Hashcat requires correct hash mode.
Wrong identification leads to failure.

## Learning Outcome
Hash identification is a prerequisite for password analysis.
