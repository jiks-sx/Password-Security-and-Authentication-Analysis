# Lab 03 – Hash Identification

## Objective
Identify hash types based on structure and length.

## Theory Mapping
- Hash algorithms
- Offline attack preparation

## Identifier
-Command:

hash-identifier

## Hash Length Guide
- MD5      → 32 hexadecimal characters
- SHA-1    → 40 hexadecimal characters
- SHA-256  → 64 hexadecimal characters

## Why This Matters
Hashcat requires the correct hash mode.
Incorrect identification leads to failed attacks.

## Learning Outcome
Hash identification is a mandatory first step in password analysis.
