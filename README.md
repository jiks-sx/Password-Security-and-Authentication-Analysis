# Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a deep theoretical and practical analysis of
password security and authentication mechanisms.
The project was completed in a **VMware-based Kali Linux lab** using
ethical and self-created data only.

## Objectives
- Understand authentication and password fundamentals
- Study password hashing and storage mechanisms
- Analyze common password attack techniques
- Perform controlled offline password analysis
- Learn modern defense strategies such as MFA

## Tools & Environment
- VMware
- Kali Linux
- Hashcat
- RockYou wordlist

## Key Learnings
- Weak passwords are easily cracked
- Fast hash algorithms are insecure for passwords
- Salting and slow hashing improve security
- MFA significantly reduces account compromise risk

## Ethical Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only**.
All experiments were performed on self-generated passwords
in a local lab environment.

## Structure
- `theory/` – Deep concept explanations
- `practical/` – Hands-on labs (VMware + Kali)
- `report/` – Final internship report

##  Outcome
Strong understanding of password security attacks and defenses.
