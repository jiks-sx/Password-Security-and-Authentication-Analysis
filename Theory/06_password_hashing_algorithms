# Password Hashing Algorithms 
## MD5 and SHA Family

These algorithms were designed for:
- Data integrity
- Speed

They were NOT designed for passwords.

Fast hashing helps attackers.

## bcrypt – Design Philosophy

bcrypt was designed with one goal:
"Make password cracking expensive"

Features:
- Slow computation
- Built-in salting
- Adjustable cost factor

Slowness protects passwords.

## Argon2 – Modern Defense

Argon2 adds:
- Memory hardness
- CPU hardness
- Time cost

This defeats:
- GPU attacks
- ASIC attacks

Argon2 assumes attackers have powerful hardware.
