# Security Fundamentals

## Why Security Exists

Security exists because digital systems store valuable assets such as:
- Personal information
- Financial data
- Intellectual property
- Authentication credentials

If security did not exist, anyone could access or modify these assets.

## Core Goals of Security (CIA Triad)

1. Confidentiality
   Ensures data is visible only to authorized users.

2. Integrity
   Ensures data is not modified without authorization.

3. Availability
   Ensures systems remain accessible when needed.

Passwords directly protect confidentiality and indirectly protect integrity.

## Security Is Risk Management

Security does not mean "100% safe".
Security means:
- Making attacks difficult
- Making attacks expensive
- Reducing damage when failure happens

Passwords are one layer, not total security.
