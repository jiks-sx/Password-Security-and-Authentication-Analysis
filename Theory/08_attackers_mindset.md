# Attacker Mindset – How Hackers Think

## Attackers Target Scale

Attackers do not target individuals.
They target:
- Databases
- Millions of users
- Weakest configurations

## Attackers Prefer:
- Weak passwords
- No MFA
- Fast hashes
- Poor monitoring

## Attackers Avoid:
- Slow hashing
- MFA
- Rate limiting
- Logging and alerts

Security works by increasing attacker cost.
