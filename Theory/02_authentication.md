# Authentication 

## What Is Authentication?

Authentication answers the question:
"Who are you?"

It is the process of verifying a claimed identity.

Example:
- User claims: "I am admin"
- System asks: "Prove it"

## Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication:
- Identity verification
- Happens first

Authorization:
- Permission checking
- Happens after authentication

Example:
- Login → Authentication
- Access admin panel → Authorization

## Authentication Factors 

There are only three fundamental authentication factors:

1. Knowledge Factor
   Something you know (password, PIN)

2. Possession Factor
   Something you have (phone, smart card)

3. Inherence Factor
   Something you are (biometrics)

Passwords are weak because knowledge can be:
- Guessed
- Stolen
- Leaked
- Reused
