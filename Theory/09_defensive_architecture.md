# Defensive Authentication Architecture

## Defense in Depth

No single defense is sufficient.

Strong systems use multiple layers:
- Strong password policy
- Secure hashing
- Salting and stretching
- MFA
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring and logging

## Failure Assumption Model

Modern security assumes:
"Passwords will be compromised someday"

Goal:
- Reduce impact
- Detect quickly
- Prevent lateral movement

This mindset separates real security engineers from beginners.
