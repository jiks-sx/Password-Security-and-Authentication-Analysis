# Passwords – From Zero Level

## What Is a Password?

A password is a shared secret between a user and a system.

The system trusts that:
- Only the user knows the password

## Why Passwords Are Weak by Nature

Passwords rely on human memory.
Humans prefer:
- Short passwords
- Meaningful words
- Reuse across websites

Attackers exploit human behavior, not mathematics.

## Password Reuse Problem

If one website is breached:
- Attackers try same password on email, banking, social media

This is called credential stuffing.

## Passwords fail not because of technology,but because of human behavior.
